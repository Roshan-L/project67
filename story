*story*
    once upon a time in the forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree, which was on the banks of the river.
    In the  same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife. 
    
    One day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits. 
    The crocodile came back the next day for some more fruits as he loved them. Days passed by the monkey and crocodile, they became friends.

    One day, the monkey sent some fruits for the crocodile's wife. She ate the fruit and liked them but was jealous, as she didn't like her husband spending
    with the monkey.
